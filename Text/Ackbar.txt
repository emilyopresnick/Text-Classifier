You can see here the Death Star orbiting the forest Moon of Endor. 
Although the weapon
systems on this Death Star are not yet operational, the Death Star does 
have a strong defense mechanism. It is protected by an energy shield, 
which is generated from the nearby forest Moon of Endor. The shield 
must be deactivated if any attack is to be attempted. Once the shield 
is down, our cruisers will create a perimeter, while the fighters fly 
into the superstructure and attempt to knock out the main reactor.

There's a concerned murmur.
General Calrissian has volunteered to lead the fighter attack.
General Madine.
Proceed with the countdown. All groups assume attack coordinates.
All craft, prepare to jump to hyperspace on my mark.
May the Force be with us.
Take evasive action! Green Group, stick close to holding sector MV-7.

It's a trap!
We saw it. All craft prepare to retreat.
We have no choice, General Calrissian. Our cruisers can't repel 
firepower of that magnitude.
At that close range, we won't last long against those Star Destroyers.
The shield is down! Commence attack on theDeath Star's main reactor.
We've got to give those fighters more time. Concentrate all fire on 
that Super Star Destroyer.
Move the fleet away from the Death Star.
