Where are those transmissions you intercepted?
What have you done with those plans?
If this is a consular ship... were is the Ambassador?
Commander, tear this ship apart until you've found those plans and bring me the Ambassador. I want her alive!
Don't play games with me, Your Highness. You weren't on any mercy   mission this time. You passed directly through a restricted system. Several transmissions were beamed to this ship by rebel spies. I want to know what happened to the plans they sent you.
You're a part of the Rebel Alliance... and a traitor. Take her away!
I have traced the Rebel spies to her. Now she is my only link to find their secret base!
Leave that to me. Send a distress signal and then inform the senate that all aboard were killed!
She must have hidden the plans in the escape pod. Send a detachment down to retrieve them. See to it personally, Commander. There'll be no one to stop us this time.
The plans you refer to will soon be back in our hands.
Don't be too proud of this technological terror you've constructed. The ability to destroy a planet is insignificant next to the power of the Force.
I find your lack of faith disturbing.
 As you wish.
And, now Your Highness, we will discuss the location of your hidden Rebel base.
Her resistance to the mind probe is considerable. It will be some time before we can extract any information from her.
What do you mean?
Commence primary ignition.
 I told you she would never consciously betray the Rebellion.
They must be trying to return the stolen plans to the princess. She may yet be of some use to us.
Did you find any droids?
Send a scanning crew on board. I want every part of this ship checked.
 I sense something... a presence I  haven't felt since...
 He is here...
 A tremor in the Force. The last time I felt it was in the presence of my old master.
Don't underestimate the power of the Force.
Obi-Wan is here. The Force is with him.
Escape is not his plan. I must face him alone.
I've been waiting for you, Obi-Wan. We meet again, at last. The circle is now complete.
When I left you, I was but the learner; now I am the master.
Your powers are weak, old man.
They have just made the jump into hyperspace.
This will be a day long remembered. It has seen the end of Kenobi and it will soon see the end of the Rebellion.
 We'll have to destroy them ship to ship. Get the crews to their fighters.
Several fighters have broken off from the main group. Come with me!
 Stay in attack formation!
 I'll take them myself! Cover me!
Close up formation.
Let him go! Stay on the leader!
I'm on the leader.
  What?
