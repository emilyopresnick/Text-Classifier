Here we are.
Try and keep a positive outlook, Master.
Artoo, we’re here.
Master!
You’re all mine, General.
Coward!
You keep on running, Grievous...
There’s nowhere to run. I’m gonna take
the rest of your arms now!
Massive casualties, I know.
Finish it off up here.
Right.
Seems reasonable... I think.
I’m following your lead, Master.
Artoo, see if you can increase the power.
Just remember, this was your idea.
But that’s only part of the problem
solved. We still have to stop its
momentum.
You may want to step aside for this,
Chancellor.
Ready as I’ll ever be, Master.
I’ve missed you so much.
How many months?
What is it?
That’s nothing. I’ve already forgotten
how I got it.
Sooner than expected now that Count Dooku
is out of the picture.
And I will be, Padme, I promise. Is that
why you’re so nervous lately?
I know.
One day things will be different. We’ll
be able to live out in the open.
I’m ready.
I'm sorry, I was held up. I have no
excuse. 
What's wrong then? 
Well, that can only mean less
deliberating and more action. It will
make it easier for us to end this war. 
Be careful of what? 
What for? 
He didn't inform the Jedi Council?
That's unusual, isn't it? 
I know the Council has grown wary of his
power, mine also for that matter. Aren't
we all working together to save the
Republic? Why all this distrust? 
The Jedi will no longer report to the
Senate? 
With all due respect, sir, the Council is
in no mood for more constitutional
amendments. 
Of course. 
I can assure you that the Jedi are
dedicated to the values of the Republic. 
For what? I don't understand. 
Me? A Master? I’m overwhelmed, sir, but
the Council elects its own members. They
will never accept this.
