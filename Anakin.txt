There isn't a droid made that can out fly
you, Master, and no other way to get to
the Chancellor... 
Break left, fly through the guns on that
tower. 
Don't worry. I'm coming around behind
you. 
Dead ahead! Closing... lock onto him,
Artoo. 
We got him, Artoo! 
I copy, Artoo. 
Good idea... I need some room to
maneuver, though. 
Cut right. Do you hear me? Cut right.
Don't let him get a handle on you. Come
on, Artoo, lock on! Lock on! 
We're locked on... we've got him. 
Yeah! We got him... good going, Artoo. 
Lock onto them, Artoo. Master, General
Grievous's ship is directly ahead. 
How many back there. Artoo? 
Three... Four... that's not good. 
I know, I know.
I know, I know! 
I'm going low and left. 
Hang on, Artoo. Obi-Wan, do you copy?
I'm going to pull them through the
needle. 
Sorry, no choice. Come down here and
thin them out a little. 
Easy, Artoo... we've done this before. 
Wrong thought, Artoo. 
I'm through. 
I'm going to go help them out! 
Missiles! Pull up! 
They're coming around! 
Surge all power units, Artoo! Stand by
the reverse thrusters.
We got 'em, Artoo! 
I see them... Buzz Droids. 
Move to the right so I can get a clear
shot. 
Steady, steady...
I agree, bad idea. Swing right, ease
over... steady... 
Move to the right. 
I'm not leaving without you, Obi-Wan. 
Get 'em, Artoo. Watch out! 

Yeah, you got him! 
Stay on my wing, the General's Command
Ship is dead ahead. Easy, pull up...
Head for the hangar. 
Oh! Sorry, Master. 
Tap into the ship's computers. 
I sense Count Dooku’s presence. 
Next move? 

Artoo, go back. I need you to stay with
the ship. 
Ready.
Well then, we're safe for the time being. 
They're sealing this section off. 

Here's a way out. 
Destroyers! 
Well, there's more than one way out of
here. 
Are you all right? 
My powers have doubled since the last
time we met. 
I shouldn't... 
I, I couldn't stop myself. 
Yes, but he was an unarmed prisoner. 
I shouldn't have done that, Chancellor.
It's not the Jedi way. 
No... it wasn’t like that this time.
I suppose.
He seems to be all right. 
His fate will be the same as ours. 
Artoo, we’re in the same elevator as
before. Get us back down to the hangar.
The burden is all mine, and I don’t want
to hear to any more talk of it.
You’ll be back in the Senate in no time.
On our way out of here.
He’s dead.
Well, things didn’t go that smoothly. He
wasn’t exactly willing to surrender.
He never would have talked, Master.
Yes, Master.









I will do my best to uphold the
principles of the Jedi Order. 
I understand. 
What?! How can you do this? It’s
outrageous, it's unfair... How can one be
on the Council and not be a Master? 
Forgive me, Master. 
I know that system well. It would take
us little time to drive the droids off
that planet. 
I knew it. Master Windu has always
opposed me. Can’t you see it?
Then what kind of nonsense is this, put
me on the Council and not make me a
Master? That's never been done in the
history of the Jedi. 
I didn't ask to be put on the Council. 
You mean divided loyalties. 
The Council is only upset because I'm the
youngest to ever serve. 
Master, you of all people should have
confidence in my abilities. I know where
my loyalties lie. 
I sense there's more to this talk than
you're saying.
And?
Just say what you have to say, Obi-Wan. 
They want me to spy on the Chancellor?
That's treason! 
Why didn't the Council give me this
assignment when we were in session?
The Chancellor’s not a bad man, Obi-Wan.
He's watched out for me ever since I
arrived here. 
The Senate demanded that he stay longer. 
You're asking me to do something against
the Jedi Code. Against the Republic,
against a mentor, and a friend. That's
what's out of place here. Why are you
asking this of me? 
You wanted to see me, Chancellor.
At last, we'll be able to capture that
coward and end this war. 
They try. 
I'm not sure I understand. 
I don't think... 
You speak like a Jedi, Chancellor.
I know they don't trust you. 
I have to admit that lately my trust in
them has been shaken. 
I don't know what to say. 
The Jedi use their power for good.
...evil. 
The Sith rely on their passion for their
strength. They think inwardly, only
about themselves. 
The Jedi are selfless... they only care
about others. 
I'm not sure it is wrong. 
No. Should I have?
He could actually save people from death? 
What happened to him? 
Is it possible to learn this power? 
A partial message was intercepted in a
diplomatic packet from the Chairman of
Utapau. 
The Chancellor has requested that I lead
the campaign. 
He was not so successful the last time he
met Grievous.
No offense, Master, but I'm only stating
a fact.
You're going to need me on this one,
Master. 
Master! 
Master, I've disappointed you. I haven’t
been very appreciative of your training.
I’ve been arrogant and I apologize. I've
just been so frustrated with the Council.
But your friendship, it means everything
to me. 
Well, there's always a first time. 
Obi-Wan, may the Force be with you. 
What do you mean? 
Surely Senator Amidala can be trusted. 
I'm sure you're mistaken. 
I simply don't sense betrayal in Senator
Amidala. 
It’s nothing, Chancellor.
Yes, Master. 
I hate it just as much as you do.
I know, Padme. I’m looking for a
solution.
Don’t talk like that.
I am a Jedi Master. 
For us, yes, not just for me. Eventually
they’re going to learn the truth.
I can prevent that from happening.
This conversation is over for now. I’ll
see you later tonight.
Master Windu...
You don’t understand, Master.
What are you going to do now?
They will expel me, Master Windu.
You’ve never like me. You were always
set against me.
Tread carefully, Master Windu. I am a
Jedi Master as well.
Then I take that as a threat on my...
(ignites his lightsaber)
Life!
You’ve made a big mistake, Master Windu.
No, my power knows no bounds.
I’m sorry, Master Windu. But it’s either
you or me.
Stay out of this, Padme.
Stop fighting me, Padme!
Stop it!
He was going to expose me, Padme. 
You saw how he threatened me?
I’m sorry, are you alright?
I’m so sorry.
Leave that to me. I’ll take care of
this.
Something’s happened.
They will never forgive me for this.
I’ve done something terrible, Chancellor.
I killed someone, an innocent man.
They’ll never forgive me. I’ll be
expelled from the Order!
No.
Master Windu.
I came here straight away. I didn’t know
where else to turn.
All this time the Jedi Council has been
watching me... watching us. Master Windu
had been following me for days.
He confronted me about my relationship to
you. He said I was being corrupted by
your influence.
I told him he didn’t understand, and that
he was suspicious out of pure jealousy.
He began accusing me of treason to the
Republic, and betrayal of the Jedi. He
knew about Padme.
He would have exposed me. He was going
to tell the Council everything. Master
Windu always doubted me, ever since I was
a child! 
He never wanted to allow me into the
Order in the first place! 
Chancellor, what am I going to do?
I can’t involve you in this. You’ve done
so much for me already.
Thank you, Chancellor. You’re the only
one who understands me.
Chancellor, we have just received a
report from Master Kenobi. 
He has killed General Grievous. I should
be there fighting with him. 
I wish I knew. More and more I get the
feeling that I am being excluded from the
Council. I know there are things about
the Force that they are not telling me. 
How do you know the ways of the Force? 
You know of the dark side?
Expel me, for what?
How do you know this? Who told you?
I want the world to know that I love her,
and that we are married.
Why are you confronting me like this?
How?
Train me? You’re not a Jedi.
You... you’re a Sith. 
You’re Lord Sidious!
But Count Dooku?
Then this entire war, all of it, this was
your plan from the beginning!
Then it’s true, the dark side is
stronger.
I don’t know what to think!
I can feel your power surging throughout
the room.
And what happens to Padme?
And in its place?
No, what are you doing?
It’s unlike anything I’ve ever known.
What must I do?
He is harmless.
Is Obi-Wan with them?
He is my friend, but he was a threat to
us all.
I pledge myself to your teachings. To
the ways of the Sith. 



I agree, Master. The Jedi's next move
will be against the Senate.
I fully understand, my Master.
What about the other Jedi spread across
the galaxy? 
Thank you, Master.
Is this the best you can do!
Now you’re all mine.
Anakin Skywalker is dead!
Your vain pleas will not save you from
me, Cin Drellig. The Jedi Order is no
more!
Misguided fool, there is only the Dark
Side of the Force!
This is the end for you, Cin Drellig.
Your faithful service has been
appreciated.
It is better that you save your words and
concentrate on fighting, Jedi.
How wise of you.
There is no escape from this Temple.
Anakin was a fool! I am a Lord of the
Sith!
I no longer need the help of the Jedi!
I am now more powerful than you could
ever imagine!
Enough of this!
Did you kill them all, Sergeant?
Good. Burn the Temple to the ground.
Yes, my Master.
The niece of Plo Koon escaped during the
fight, but she is of no consequence. I
will hunt her down as I do the others.
Good. Let the rule of the Empire
commence.
Artoo, stay with the ship. 
The Separatists are taken care of, My
Master. 
Thank you, My Master. 
Very good, My Lord. 
Padme, I saw your ship... 
It's all right, you're safe now. But I
told you to go to Naboo. This changes
everything. 
Obi-Wan? He’s alive?
And what did you tell them?
It doesn’t even matter now. Things are
going to be completely different for us.
We’re free to live our lives now, like
we’ve always wanted.
What are you doing here?
Go to the control tower, Padme.
Shutup, Obi-Wan. Padme, do as I say.
Now!
I have chosen my own path, Not the one
you would have me take.
Master Windu attacked me. I had no
choice.
I spared your life at the Chancellor’s
office. You shouldn’t have come back.
I absolve you of your guilt, Obi-Wan, but
I have a new master now.
You’ve left me no choice but to kill you.
My name is Darth Vader.
That’s where you’re wrong.
Get out of my way.
This is all your fault, Obi-Wan!
Padme!
This is the end, Obi-Wan. You should
have vanished when I gave you the chance.
Such foolish compassion only makes you
weak. I have had enough of your rules
and righteousness!
Goodbye, old friend.
Yes, My Master. 
Where is Padme? Is she safe, is she all
right? 
Padme, forgive me. I never meant to harm
you.

Enter.
Was Padme still with child?
That will be all.
