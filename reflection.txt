 I chose lines from Obi-Wan Kenobi and Anakin Skywalker from the movie Revenge of the Sith. I left out some lines of dialogue from each to use in the new bodies of text as a test. In addition, I also used lines from Darth Vader in A New Hope as well as Admiral Ackbar from Return of the Jedi. I chose these characters’ dialogue as the new body of texts as I thought it would be interesting to see if my code could figure out that Anakin and Darth Vader are the same character. Similarly, I wanted to see if a character from the rebellion would be more similar to another character from the rebellion, which in this case would be Obi-Wan. 
        The results of the comparisons were very interesting. The two test cases matched with their sources, which was not surprising. Darth Vader matched with Anakin which I thought was very cool. Despite having Anakin's character switching, the code was still able to distinguish that he was more similar to Darth Vader. Ackbar was more similar to Anakin as well. This surprised me, as I had thought he would be similar to Obi-Wan. However, it does make sense as both Anakin and Ackbar flew ships, therefore their dialogue reflected that and made them more similar. With this, I believe that my text classification program works very effectively. With that, there is always room to grow. Possible improvements include measuring how frquest the character uses different tones. This could be accomplished by making a dictionary for different tones (happy, angry, sad…). Within those dictionaries have keywords that are words typically used to represent those tones and count how many times they appear. Next, compare the lengths of the dictionaries and the total frequency of words to determine which tone was more prevalent. This technique would be useful when dealing with dialogue of characters, as a singular character typically uses a distinct tone.
