Look out, four droids inbound... 
We've got to split them up. 
Easy for you to say. Why am I always the
bait? 
Anakin, they're all over me!
I'm going down on the deck. 
Hurry up! I don't like this! 
Ouch! 
Don't even try to fix it, Arfour. I've
shut it down. 
Next time you're the bait... Now let's
find the Command Ship and get on with it. 
I see it. Oh, this is going to be easy. 
Not this time. There's too much at
stake. We need help. Odd Ball, do you
copy?
Mark my position and form your squad up
behind me...
Add five Tri-fighters on the right... 
Take it easy, Anakin. 
Five more on the right! 
I'm going high and right. 
Stay with me... swing back and right...
help me engage. Now back off... Let them
pass between us. 
All right, engage... and hurry. These
droids are over me. 
Anakin, you have four on your tail. 
Four more closing from your left. 
Break right and go high. 
He still has much to learn. 
Too dangerous. First Jedi rule:
"Survive." 
Just keep me steady... hold on... not
yet... now break left. 
You'll never get through there, Anakin.
It's too tight. 
Use the Force, think yourself through,
the ship will follow. 
No, no! They are doing their job so we
can do ours. Head for the Command Ship!
They overshot us... 
All right, Arfour. No, no. Nothing too
fancy. 
Flying is for droids. 
I'm hit! Anakin? 
Arfour, be careful. You have one...
Oh, dear. They're shutting down all the
controls. 

The mission. Get to the Command Ship.
Get the Chancellor! I'm running out of
tricks here. 
In the name of... 
Anakin, hold your fire, hold your fire.
You're not helping here. 
Wait, wait, I can't see a thing! My
cockpit's fogging. They're all over me,
Anakin. 
Hold on, Anakin. You're going to get us
both killed! Get out of here. There's
nothing more you can do. 
Blast it... I can't see... my controls
are gone. 
Artoo, hit the buzz droid's center eye. 
Great, Artoo. 





In short, they are going very well.
Saleucami has fallen, and Master Vos has
moved his troops to Boz Pity. 
The Senate is expected to vote more
executive powers to the Chancellor today. 
Anakin, be careful of your friend
Palpatine. 
He has requested your presence.
He would not say. 
All of this is unusual, and it's making
me feel uneasy. You're probably aware
that relations between the Council and
the Chancellor are stressed. 
The Force grows dark, Anakin, and we are
all affected by it. Be wary of your
feelings. 
It may take some time. We do not have
many ships 
to spare. 
And yet, it would be fatal for us to
allow the droid armies to regroup. 
He's right, that is a system we cannot
afford to lose. It's the main navigation
route for the southwestern quadrant. 
Not that argument again, Anakin. I’ve
told you time and time again to get rid
of such foolishness. You’re angry and
you’re lashing out.
Calm down, Anakin. You have been given a
great honor. To be on the Council at
your age... it's never happened before.
Listen to me, Anakin. 
The fact of the matter is you're too
close to the Chancellor. The Council
doesn't like it when he interferes in
Jedi affairs. 
But it's what you wanted. Your
friendship seems to have paid off.
And regardless of how it happened,
Anakin, you find yourself in a delicate
situation. 
I warned you there was tension between
the Council and the Chancellor. I was
very clear. 
No, it is not, Anakin. I worry when you
speak of jealousy and pride. Those are
not Jedi thoughts. They're dangerous,
dark thoughts. 
I certainly hope so. 
Anakin, the only reason the Council has
approved your appointment is because the
Chancellor trusts you. 
Anakin, look, I am on your side. I
didn't want to see you put in this
situation. 
The Council wants you to report on all of
the Chancellor's dealings. They want to
know what he's up to. 
We are at war, Anakin. The Jedi Council
is sworn to uphold the principles of the
Republic, even if the Chancellor does
not
This assignment is not to be on record.
The Council asked me to approach you on
this personally. 
And that is precisely why you must help
us, Anakin. Our allegiance is to the
Senate, not to its leader, who has
managed to stay in office long after his
term has expired.
Yes, but use your feelings, Anakin.
Something is out of place. 
The Council is asking you. 
Anakin did not take to his assignment
with much enthusiasm. 

He'll be all right. I trust Anakin with
my life. 
With all due respect, Master, is he not
the Chosen One? Is he not to destroy the
Sith and bring balance to the Force? 
He will not let me down. He never has. 
Does everyone agree? 
Oh no, you're quite right, but I do have
the most experience with his ways of
combat. 
Oh, I agree. However, it may turn out
just to be a wild bantha chase. 

You are strong and wise, Anakin, and I am
very proud of you. I have trained you
since you were a boy. I have taught you
everything I know, and you have become a
far greater Jedi than I could ever hope
to be... and you have saved my life more
times than I can remember. But be
patient, Anakin. It won't be long before
the Council makes you a Jedi Master. 
Don't worry. I have enough Clones with
me to take three systems the size of
Utapau. I think I'll be able to handle
the situation, even without your help.
Good-bye, old friend. May the Force be
with you. 
I'll keep them distracted until you get
there. Just don't take too long. 
Cato Nemoidia... for starters.
Very well, the burden is on me not to
destroy all the droids before you get
there. 
Unfortunately, the war. 
With your kind permission, I should like
some fuel and to use your city as a base
as I search nearby systems for General
Grievous. 
I understand.
Tell your people to take shelter. If you
have warriors, now is the time. 
Geenine, take the Fighter back to the
ship. I'm staying here. Tell Cody I've
made contact. 
Hello, there! 
Your move. 
And I trained the Jedi who defeated Count
Dooku. 
I may not defeat your droids, but my
troops certainly will. 
Not to worry, General. That is my
problem.
Home sweet home.
We shall leave that up to destiny, Cody.
(pats Cody’s shoulder)
You and your men get some rest. You
deserve it.
Something is wrong, Master Windu has yet
to return.
What is it?
I’ll go and round up others to accompany
me.
Where is Master Windu?

In the name of the Galactic Senate of the
Republic, you are under arrest,
Chancellor.
Treason against the Republic.
That’s a risk the Senate and the jedi
Council are willing to take.
Anakin, what are you doing?!
You old fool. The oppression of the Sith
will never return. Your plot to regain
control of the Republic is over!
Anakin, help me! We can put an end to
the Sith scourge, once and for all!
Anakin, please!
I will kill you myself!
Aarrrrggghhhhh... 
Anakin, please!
Senator, this is General Kenobi. Are you
alright?
I don’t have much time. The Temple is
close to collapsing. 
Cody, it’s me, General Kenobi. Surely
you remember me?
We’re both going to die if we don’t leave
here now
Very well...
I’m sorry, Cody.
You were attacked by your Clones, as
well?
How many other Jedi managed to survive?
Have we had any contact from the Temple?
I saw no survivors there. The Clones
killed everybody. I’m afraid the Temple
is destroyed.
Anakin has turned to the Dark Side. He
is now a slave to Palpatine.
I failed with Anakin, Master Yoda. This
is partly my failure.
But how could Anakin have fallen so
quickly and completely?
There is too much at stake here, and we
need a clearer picture of what has
happened. 
No, I don't think so. The Chancellor
will not be able to control the thousands
of star systems without keeping the
Senate intact. 
It would be better if we stayed with the
Senator. 
There are Clones on every level. They’re
looking for survivors
What we’re about to tell you, Padme, will
come as a great shock. Anakin has turned
to the Dark Side.
Of the Force. 
Where is Anakin?
Padme, it’s alright. We know your
secret.
And you didn’t notice anything strange
about his behavior?
What is it, Master?
You have to remember, Senator, under the
circumstances her loyalty would be to
Anakin first and foremost.
We wait. She will lead us straight to
Anakin sooner or later.
Thank you for your time, Senator. We
will show ourselves out.
What happened, Anakin?
Where did it all go wrong?
No, why don’t you stay and listen to what
your husband has become.
How many lives have you taken, Anakin?
How many lives did it take for your get
what you wanted?
That much is for certain. Master Windu
was right about you. About your
overwhelming pride and arrogance. Did
you feel any guilt after you killed him?
There is always a choice, Anakin.
Unlike you, I do feel guilty, about the
way I failed you. I thought I could
train you as well as Yoda himself.
Yes, I know.
We were friends, Anakin, fellow Jedi
serving a greater purpose than ourselves.
Doesn’t that mean anything to you?
Leave her out of this!
Let her go! It’s me you want!
I've heard that before, Anakin... but I
never thought I'd hear it from you. 
I refused to give up on you, Anakin.
That is what it means to be good and
just.
Then you truly are beyond saving.
I loved you, Anakin! You were my
brother!
Save your energy, Padme. We’re on our
way to get you help.
What happened to her? 
What can be done for her?
Don't give up, Padme. We need you to be
strong for your babies.
They’re beautiful, Padme.
You’re most welcome.
I don’t know if you can hear me, Padme.
You have given birth to healthy twins. 
No harm shall befall them. I swear it.
It’s not your fault or mine, Padme.
Anakin chose his own path. We all tried
to reach him and reason with him.
Save your energy.
We must take them somewhere the Sith will
not sense their presence. 
And what of the boy? 
I will take the child and watch over him.
Master Yoda, do you think Anakin's twins
will be able to defeat Darth Sidious? 
Training? 
Who?
I will be able to talk with him?
