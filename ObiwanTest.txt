Have you noticed the shields are still
up? 
Oh, I have a bad feeling about this. 
Artoo, locate the Chancellor. 
The Chancellor's signal is coming from
right there. The observation platform at
the top of that spire. 
I sense a trap. 
Spring the trap. 
Here, take this, and wait for orders. 
Anakin... 
Fuel. The slightest charge from our
sabers will send this ship into oblivion.
That's why they've stopped shooting. 
Your idea of safe is not the same as
mine. 
Six droids coming our way! 
We don't want to get out, we want to get
moving. Artoo, Artoo. Do you copy?
Activate elevator...
31174. 
Chancellor. 
You won't get away this time, Dooku. 
Where are we?
It’s good to be back, Chancellor.
And Dooku?
Dead? Our plan was to return with him as
our prisoner, Anakin.
How are we going to explain this to the
Council? Dooku would’ve been a wealth of
information to us.
Is this true, Anakin.
Then the word of the Supreme Chancellor
is good enough for me.
It simply can’t be this easy.

Anakin, wait.
I’m afraid so. Wait here, Chancellor.
I’ve got them!
He’s gone, Anakin. We’ve got what we
came for, so let’s get out of here.
This ship is on its last leg. We best be
going.
The Chancellor’s right, Anakin. If
Grievous’s ship hits the surface...
Any suggestions?
That requires too much firepower.
Besides half the fleet would have to
chase it down.
Well, we have to do something.
Anakin?
Squad Seven can mop up here. We can beat
the ship to the surface.
This is going to be close.
Actually, it was the Chancellor’s, but
point taken.
We are going to make it.
We’ve trained all our lives for a moment
such as this, Anakin.
There is no such thing as luck where the
Force is concerned.
Are you ready, Anakin?
Then let’s begin.
And that, Chancellor, is an example of
the power of the Force.
It is Anakin you should be thanking. He
was the hero yet again.
Chancellor Palptine assured me that it
was in self-defense.
Then you do not believe Anakin? Is that
what you’re saying?
That reminds me, Palpatine did say
something rather strange to me. He
referred to Count Dooku as Lord Tyranus.
Is it possible the Chancellor could have
heard this name elsewhere?
Only amongst the Council have we ever
called Dooku Tyranus, and even then, not
often.
Oh, is that all?
You missed the report on the Outer Rim
sieges.
